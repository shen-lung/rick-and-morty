# Challenge

The challenge is to develop a search screen using the Rick & Morty API (https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest).
The following features/tasks should be accomplished:
 - The user should be able to search any episode from Rick & Morty by a search textbox
 - The user only should see 10 episodes by page, and must be able to go to any other page (pagination feature)
 - The user should be able to clean de the filter
 - For backend communication you can use the REST API or the GraphQL service (Consider using any client you prefer accordingly, ex. Axios, ApolloClient, ReactQuery, etc)
 - You have all the freedom to use the design and layout you prefer.
